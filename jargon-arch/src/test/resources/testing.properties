# properties for unit testing with an IRODS sandbox
#
# These unit testing features are still experimental,
# use with caution (and give feedback!)
#
# WARNING: the unit tests are meant to be run against an IRODS installation on
# a developer workstation that you do not mind becoming corrupted,
# and that you do not mind re-installing!
#
# The tests use wrapped icommands for some setup and teardown operations.  Please configure your
# irodsEnv file to point to your test server as your test user, then set the properties below.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# If you want to run tests, set test.confirm to true, otherwise, TestingPropertiesHelper will
# terminate with an exception  test.confirm=true|false
test.confirm=true
