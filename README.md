### git tag: 


## News


https://github.com/DICE-UNC/jargon/milestone/13

This version of Jargon is currently targeted at Cloud Browser and REST.  There are still some features that are considered early access and may not support a full range
of use cases for general cases, and having a separate stream allows us flexibility to break API on these more advanced features, such as advanced paging and virtual collections support.

Please go to [[https://github.com/DICE-UNC/jargon]] for the latest news and info.

=======

Jargon-core consists of the following libraries

* jargon-core - base libraries, implementation of the iRODS protocol
* jargon-data-utils - additional functionality for dealing with iRODS data, such as building trees, storing information in iRODS on behalf of applications, and doing diffs between local and iRODS
* jargon-user-tagging - code for using free tagging and other metadata metaphors on top of iRODS
* jargon-user-profile - allows management of user profile and related configuration data in a user home directory
* jargon-ticket - support for ticket processing
* jargon-httpstream - stream http content into iRODS via Jargon
* jargon-ruleservice - support for running and managing rules from interfaces
* jargon-pool - initial implementation of commons-pool caching of iRODS agent connections.  This is initially for WebDav, and will be utilized as an option in REST and cloud browser.  Consider this code experimental
 
## Requirements

* Jargon depends on Java 1.8+
* Jargon is built using Apache Maven2, see POM for dependencies
* Jargon supports iRODS 4.1.0 through 4.2.X

## Libraries

Jargon-core uses Maven for dependency management.  See the pom.xml file for references to various dependencies.

Note that the following bug and feature requests are logged in GForge with related commit information [[https://github.com/DICE-UNC/jargon/issues]]

## Changes

#### Remove old thumbnail code #165 

Remove old image thumbnail code that relied on specific 'lifetime library' configuration.  This will later be replaced by a more globally applicable set of tools.  Likely in the jargon-extensions package

####  Add file to string and vice versa to support cloud browser editor #166 

Add file to string and vice versa in FileSamplerService of data utils.  This allows cloud browser to turn a file into an edit pane and store edits to irods.

#### File save via cloud browser is deleting metadata #232

Fix save of string to file (in Stream2StreamAO) to not delete a file when overwriting, so as to preserve metadata

#### Add list user groups like x method #233

Enhanced user group and user queries for cloud browser

#### add col user type to genquery #235

Add user type to LIKE queries to discriminate users from groups in find 'like' queries

#### Implement client hints #268

Implement the client hints api (initially to determine iCAT type for MetaLnx), returning information about the connected iRODS data grid. This
is implemented as a new method in EnvironmentalInfoAO, and is supported with a refreshible cache behavior. Specifically the new ClientHints domain
object includes an ability to interrogate the type of iCAT.
