# Docker Test Framework for Jargon

The docker-test-framework subdirectory includes entries for various iRODS versions. Upon selection of a version, the `docker compose up` command 
can be issued from that subdirectory. For example:

```
cd docker-test-framework
cd 4-3
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

This should start an iRODS server and resource server on a Docker private network. This will also build and run a maven test instance. This is 
a JDK 11 and Maven enabled container that can be accessed via a shell. The container mounts the jargon source code and is pre-configured with maven settings to match the iRODS containers.

Once iRODS is running, it can be addressed via port 1247 for most operations, though parallel transfers via ephemeral ports is difficult from the local host. For this reason, a Dockerfile is provided at the root that can be build and run. This contains OpenJDK11 and maven and mounts the jargon source code as a Docker volume. This allows interactive coding and testing.

For illustration, here is a view of a running test framework.

```

**NOTE (4-3 directory only)**: _"iRODS Consumer is ready."_ will be printed to the terminal when the framework is ready for use.

To build and test, simply cd to `/usr/src/jargon` and run `mvn` commands after logging into the test container. This snippet illustrates logging in and positioning to the top of the Jargon project, ready to issue maven commands

```
$ docker exec -it maven bash
# cd /usr/src/jargon
# ls
CHANGELOG.md  README.md     docker-build-test.sh  docker-test-framework   jargon-core	     jargon-mdquery  jargon-ruleservice  jargon-user-tagging  pom.xml	    target
LICENSE.txt   data-profile  docker-build.sh	  eclipse-formatting.xml  jargon-data-utils  jargon-pool     jargon-ticket	 jargon-zipservice    settings.xml  user-guide
```

**NOTE**: The settings.xml file is mounted that has the correct coordinates for the iRODS grid pre-configured with test accounts, resources, groups, etc as expected by the Jargon unit test framework.

## Running Specific Tests

```
mvn test -Dtest='<class>#<method>,<class>#<method>, ...' -DfailIfNoTests=false -pl <module> -am
```

Below is an example demonstrating how to run two tests in the jargon-core module.

```
mvn test \
    -Dtest='DataObjectAOImplTest#testReplicaTruncateNoTargetReplica,DataObjectAOImplTest#testReplicaTruncateInvalidInputs' \
    -DfailIfNoTests=false \
    -pl jargon-core \
    -am
```

## Running PAM Tests

The certificates and PAM configuration must be set up manually to test PAM.  The following steps outline how to do this.

1. Before starting the docker containers, update settings.xml:

```
<test.option.pam>true</test.option.pam>
<test.option.ssl.configured>true</test.option.ssl.configured>
```

2. Start the containers as described above. 
3. Create the certificates on the catalog provider and configure SSL in the ~irods/.irods/irods_environment.json.
4. Create the "pam" user in iRODS.
5. Create the "pam" user on the catalog provider.  Give this user the unix password of "pam=;!\pam" to match the value in the test.
6. Copy the cert (server.crt) to the maven container and import this into the cacerts file using the following (cacerts password is "changeit").

```
keytool -import -file /path/to/server.crt -keystore /usr/local/openjdk-11/lib/security/cacerts
```

7. At this point you should be able to run the PAM authentication tests:

```
cd /usr/src/jargon
mvn test -Dtest='PAMAuthTest' -DfailIfNoTests=false -pl jargon-core -am
```
