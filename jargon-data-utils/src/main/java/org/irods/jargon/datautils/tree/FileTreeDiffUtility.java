	 * Generate a tree model that is the diff between the left hand side and the
	 * iRODS file system on the right hand side. This diff tree will depict the
	 * common directory structure and indicate places where files or collections
	 * differ from the perspective of the 'left hand side' file.
	 * <p>
	 * The {@code FileTreeDiffEntry} will indicate the type of difference found.
	 * This is the user data object that is kept in a {@code FileTreeNode} in
	 * the resulting {@code FileTreeModel}.
	 * <p>
	 * This utility will compare file-to-file for data objects. Since local and
	 * iRODS time stamps are not a good indicator for direct comparison, the
	 * utility compares two file (data objects) based on length. Optionally, the
	 * iRODS timestamp can be compared to a provided timestamp value to treat
	 * files modified after the given cut-off as 'changed'.
	 * <p>
	 * Note that setting either the left hand or right hand side timestamp to
	 * {@code NO_TIMESTAMP_CHECKS} will turn of timestamp checking. This is
	 * appropriate for an initial synch operation.
