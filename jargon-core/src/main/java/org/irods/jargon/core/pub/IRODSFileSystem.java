/**
 * This class is a simplified way of obtaining a connection and getting
 * references to the key factory classes. This class encapsulates a default
 * <code>IRODSProtocolManager</code> responsible for creating connections. This
 * default manager will create a new connection for each requested connection.
 * For other behaviors, such as pooling or cacheing of connections, use other
 * implementations of <code>IRODSProtocolManager</code> directly.
 * <p/>
 * Typical usage would be to create an instance of this object, then use the
 * <code>IRODSFileSystem</code> class to obtain a reference of an
 * <code>IRODSAccessObjectFactory</code> and a <code>IRODSFileFactory</code> .
 * These two factory objects allow creation of various iRODS file
 * implementations that map to the <code>java.io.*</code> packages, and to
 * create various Access Objects.
 * <p/>
 * An Access Object represents the various domains within iRODS (such as User,
 * Resource, Collection) and allows accessing, updating, managing metadata, and
 * other operations specific to each of these objects. Access Objects will
 * operate and return various domain objects that represent data within iRODS.
 * The factories will return instances of file objects and Access Objects upon
 * request using the provided <code>IRODSAccount</code>. The
 * <code>IRODSAccount</code> indicates the iRODS server to which that Access or
 * file object is connected. In other words, one IRODSFileSystem object will
 * manage connections to multiple iRODS servers.
 * <p/>
 * After a connection is no longer needed, it must be closed by using the proper
 * close method contained in the <code>IRODSFileSystem</code> object. Please
 * consult the method documentation of this class for various close options.
 * <p/>
 * It is important to note that the <code>IRODSFileSystem</code> is not created
 * multiple times in typical usage. The proper technique is to create the
 * <code>IRODSFileSystem</code>, and place it in a shared context (such as in
 * the ApplicationContext of a servlet application, use a shared reference, or
 * wrap this object in a singleton for lookup. The JUnit tests can be somewhat
 * misleading in terms of proper usage. The object is safe to share between
 * multiple threads. The underlying connections are tied to a
 * <code>ThreadLocal</code>, such that they are not shared between threads. This
 * <code>IRODSFileSystem</code> object does hold shared instances of objects
 * that manage connections, and these objects are intended to manage the
 * creation of connections across the entire application. The shared objects are
 * designed to manage these connections across multiple threads.
 * <p/>
