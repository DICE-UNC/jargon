/**
 * Improved tools for managing paging through children collections and data
 * objects underneath an iRODS path. iRODS keeps collections and data objects in
 * separate places, so some work needs to be done to manage paging back and
 * forth across this boundary. Mostly this service relies on a POJO descriptor
 * of the current state of a listing which is kept on the client and passed back
 * to this method on subsequent paging requests. In this way, a client can just
 * say 'page forward' and delegate all of the head-scratching about how to
 * accomplish that to this service, which you will love, because that sucks to
 * manage mostly.
