/**
 * This is an access object that can be used to move data to, from, and between
 * iRODS resources. Generally, this should be the first place to look for
 * methods that move data. There are other objects that are of potential
 * interest, including objects that represent data objects -
 * {@link org.irods.jargon.core.pub.CollectionAO}, objects that represent iRODS
 * collections - {@link org.irods.jargon.core.pub.DataObjectAO}, and that
 * represent iRODS data objects and collections as {@code java.io.*} operations
 * - see {@link org.irods.jargon.core.pub.io.IRODSFile}.
 * <p>
 * This interface has a default implementation within Jargon. The access object
 * should be obtained using a factory, either by creating from
 * {@link org.irods.jargon.core.pub.IRODSFileSystem}, or from an
 * {@link org.irods.jargon.core.pub.IRODSAccessObjectFactory} implementation.
 * <p>
 * A word should be said about controlling transfers. There are two important
 * components to most of the methods in this class, these are the
 * {@link TransferStatusCallbackListener} and the {@link TransferControlBlock}.
 * The {@code TransferStatusCallbackListener} allows a caller of a method in
 * this class to receive call-backs. The call-backs may be an overall initiation
 * of a transfer process, intra-file call-backs that give progress within a file
 * (under development, and will be controllable by setting transfer options}),
 * and per file call-backs. These are handy to display progress bars, monitor
 * error status, and so forth. The {@code TransferControlBlock} specifies a
 * shared object between the caller, and a process running a transfer. The
 * {@code TransferControlBlock} allows bi-directional communication between a
 * client and a transfer process, and this should be synchronized properly. The
 * {@code TransferControlBlock} can signal a cancellation of a process, adjust a
 * transfer as it progresses, and contains aggregate information about the
 * transfer as it runs.
 * <p>
 * Note that both the {@code TransferControlBlock} and
 * {@code TransferStatusCallbackListener} are optional, and may be set to
 * {@code null} in the various method signatures if not needed.
 * <p>
 * Note that the status call-backs you receive need to be quickly processed by
 * the implementor of the {@code TransferStatusCallbackListener}. Jargon does
 * not play any tricks to queue up these call-backs, they are direct calls from
 * the transfer process and can block progress of a transfer if not handled
 * efficiently.
 * <p>
 * Transfers can have multiple options that control their behavior. These will
 * be added as necessary, but will likely be too numerous to specify
 * individually. For this reason, a {@link TransferOptions} class has been
 * developed. By default, Jargon will consult the {@link JargonProperties} as
 * configured in the {@link IRODSSession} object. Those may be loaded from the
 * default {@code jargon.properties} file, or those properties can be set up by
 * an application. If no {@code TransferOptions} are specified, the
 * {@code JargonProperties} will be consulted to build a default set. In many
 * cases, this is all that is required.
 * <p>
 * If particular properties are required for an individual transfer, it is
 * possible to specify those options, where they apply. These will be mostly
 * relevant to 'put' and 'get' operations. If custom properties should be set,
 * the proper procedure is to create a {@code TransferControlBlock}, typically
 * with the {@link DefaultTransferControlBlock}, and use the method to set a
 * custom {@code TransferOptions}. Note that, in
 * {@code DefaultTransferControlBlock}, the get() and set() methods are
 * synchronized so that {@code TransferOptions} may be changed while transfers
 * occur. This may be done, as each individual file transfer creates a copy of
 * the {@code TransferOptions}. To change options while a transfer is running,
 * one may create a new instance of {@code TransferOptions}, and then use the
 * synchronized method to set those options in the {@code TransferControlBlock}
 * <p>
 * Note that soft links are supported as iRODS paths in these operations.
