 * Instances of this class support I/O on random-access binary files. Methods on

 * Two sets of read methods are provided:
 *

 * <li>Single-value read methods such as int readInt().
 * <li>Multi-value read methods such as void readInts(int* values,int nValues).
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Single-value read methods read a single short, int, long, etc., and return
 * the value.
 * <p>
 * Multi-value read methods read multiple consecutive shorts, ints, longs, etc.,
 * and return them in a given array.
 * <p>
 * Two sets of write methods are provided:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Single-value write methods such as int writeInt(int value).
 * <li>Multi-value write methods such as void writeInts(int* values,int
 * nValues).
 * </ul>

 * Multi-value write methods write multiple shorts, ints, longs, etc., from an
 * array of values.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> This class offers features that extend those found in
 * java.io.RandomAccessFile. However, it <i>is not</i> a subclass, due to the
 * unfortunate use of final methods in java.io.RandomAccessFile.
