/**
 * Factory to produce IRODS access objects. This is the key object which can be
 * used to create components that can interact directly with iRODS to query
 * metadata attributes, update the catalog, and move data.
 * <p>
 * Access objects are styled after traditional DAO's, in that they deal with a
 * particular domain or service, and have methods to query for data about things
 * in iRODS, and methods to update things in iRODS. The access objects use
 * 'POJO' domain objects for input and output parameters, giving some nice,
 * simple abstractions of the iRODS metadata catalog.
 * <p>
 * Access objects are connected to iRODS at the time they are created. The
 * connection is determined by the
 * {@link org.irods.jargon.core.connection.IRODSAccount} that is specified when
 * the access object is created. The connection is managed using a
 * {@code ThreadLocal}, such that any access objects created in the same
 * thread by this factory will automatically create a connection, or will share
 * an already created connection. This also means that, at the end of any set of
 * operations, the connection must be closed. Typically, an
 * {@link IRODSFileSystem} is instantiated, and that
 * {@code IRODSFileSystem} is used to get a reference to this access object
 * factory. Once operations are done, the {@code IRODSFileSystem} can be
 * used to close connections in that thread. This factory has hooks to also
 * close those connections, and this can be used in cases where this factory is
 * injected itself into another service.
 * <p>
 * Be aware that there should only be one reference to an
 * {@code IRODSFileSystem}. This object should not be created for every
 * operation, rather, it should be created and placed in a shared context,
 * passed as a reference, or wrapped in a singleton. Looking at the JUnit code
 * for usage can be somewhat misleading in this respect.
 * <p>
 *
 * For example, if using the 'shortcut' {@code IRODSFileSystem}. object,
 * you may see a pattern of use like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  IRODSFileSystem irodsFileSystem = IRODSFileSystem.instance();
 * 
 * UserAO adminUserAO = irodsFileSystem.getIRODSAccessObjectFactory().getUserAO(irodsAccount);
 * adminUserAO.doSomething();
 * ZoneAO zoneAO = irodsFileSystem.getIRODSAccessObjectFactory().getZoneAO(irodsAccount);
 * zoneAO.doSomething()
 * 
 * irodsFileSystem.close();
 * </pre>
