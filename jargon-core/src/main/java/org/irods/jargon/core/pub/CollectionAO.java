/**
 * This is an access object that can be used to manipulate iRODS Collections.
 * This object treats the IRODSFile that represents a directory as a Collection
 * object, not as a {@code java.io.File} object. For familiar
 * {@code java.io.*} operations, see
 * {@link org.irods.jargon.core.pub.io.IRODSFile}.
 * <p>
 * This interface has a default implementation within Jargon. The access object
 * should be obtained using a factory, either by creating from
 * {@link org.irods.jargon.core.pub.IRODSFileSystem}, or from an
 * {@link org.irods.jargon.core.pub.IRODSAccessObjectFactory} implementation.
 * This class is handy for retrieving and manipulating system and user metadata
 * associated with collection objects (files), as well as performing common
 * query operations. This class also supports various iRODS file operations that
 * are not included in the standard {@code java.io.*} libraries.
 * <p>
 * For general data movement operations, also see
 * {@link org.irods.jargon.core.pub.DataTransferOperations}.
 * <p>
 * <h2>Notes</h2>
 * For soft links, AVU metadata always attaches to the given path, which can be
 * a soft link. This is somewhat different than metadata handling for data
 * objects, where the AVU metadata always associates with the canonical path.
 * For collections, AVU metadata can be different for the canonical and soft
 * linked path, and this class will use these paths as explicitly provided by
 * the caller of the metadata methods.
